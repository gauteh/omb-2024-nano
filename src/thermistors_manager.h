/*
A class to use thermistors of model DS18B20 as a thermistor string, and log some info
about both temperature reported by these, as well as inclination / motion as reported by
the IMU.

The thermistors are using the 1-wire interface. Data on pin 35, power on pin 4.

    Brainstorming
    - need to send the ID of the thermistors, or no way to know anything if one of them dies...
    - get all the IDs in advance, and find ways to have LSBs of IDs not overlapping when putting thermistors
    - thermistors resolution is 12 bits (though a bit less, but 11 is not enough, need to use 12)

    - could send, per thermistor, 3 bytes i.e. 24 bits: 6 bits "lowest significant bits of ID; 12 bits averaged reading; 6 bits "RMS"; " 
    - regarding the "RMS": may be enough to send the "max-min" of the binary reading? ...
    - regarding the 12 bits averaged reading: could compute on the fly, all in int?
    - 6 thermistors would mean: 18 bytes per packet + 1 header byte = 19 bytes per packet in the message
    - i.e., could easily send 20 packets at a time in a message if needed (let us say 10 max)
    - HOWEVER, need a couple more bytes about the IMU positioning (see under)

    - need to report the inclination of the sensor? add 2 bytes in each packet for pitch and roll discretized over their ranges? Averaged over the duration of the measurement? With 2 more bytes (1 byte for each) indicating the max pitch and roll deviation from mean observed during the measurement?
    - pitch is -90 degrees to +90 degrees
    - roll is -180 degrees to + 180 degrees

    // we collect teh IMU data at the start of the class; otherwise, delays due to the communication with the
    // DS18B20 slows too much the IMU stuff, and we get NaNs and corrupted data

    TESTING:
    - need to test at - degrees
    - need to test at + degrees
    - test the "orientation measurement" stuff
